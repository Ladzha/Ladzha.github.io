                    the daughter of Marjorie (née Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, 
                    both of whom were teachers. Jones was the oldest of three sisters and often looked 
                    after her siblings—partly because of a complicated relationship with their parents, 
                    who were both teachers. </li>
                    <li> <span class="year">1939</span> - When the raids of World War II reached London, the five-year-old Diana and her two younger sisters were torn from their suburban life and sent to Pontarddulais in Wales to live with their grandparents.

There, Jones and her two younger sisters Isobel (later Professor Isobel Armstrong, the literary critic) and Ursula (later an actress and a children's writer) spent a childhood left chiefly to their own devices. Despite struggling with dyslexia, Diana did well in school as a child and developed a keen interest in books.</li>
